Welcome to my personal Pokémon project! This is a simple command-line game built with Python to help me learn and practice programming concepts like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, and more.

## Features

- Battle against wild Pokémon or other trainers.
- Simple turn-based combat system.
- Learn and practice Python while having fun!
